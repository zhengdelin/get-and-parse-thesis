There are five species of sea turtle species in Taiwan; green turtle, hawksbill, loggerhead, olive ridley, and leatherback. Green sea turtle is the most abundant one. The coast of Taiwan is an important develop site for sea turtles. They utilize the coast as their feeding areas. This study is to describe the diets of green turtles on the east and north coasts of Taiwan, as well as the influence of sites, seasons, gender, and size on the diet selections of green turtles. Turtles were collected from New Taipei City, Keelung City, Yilan County, Miaoli County, and Hualien County. Sixty green turtles with 53 had diet items. The diet composition from the esophagus and stomach of the dead turtles were examined. Results showed that the diets were red algae (86%), green algae (8%), brown algae (6%), artificial debris (0.2%), natural debris (<0.1%), animal (0.1%), and unidentified materials (0.2%). Among the wet weight, red algae was the main diet. A total of 44 macroalgae species were identified, only Pterocladiella capillacea of red algae (IRI: 39) was the most important diet. The major diet changed with different counties and seasons. This may due to the available diet in different places and seasons were different. The diets between males and females were similar. The diet composition in all sizes were similar.

2. 2021 開發遊戲式學習模型以提升注意力缺陷過動症國小兒童的持續注意力和衝動抑制力
This study explored the effects of Game-Based Learning (GBL) on sustained attention and impulsive inhibition. The GBL, based on self-instruction strategy which was used in combination with the general curriculum, could both help students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and promote sustained attention and impulsive inhibition in the class activities. The method used to execute this study was single-subject research. The subjects were three elementary students with ADHD, the independent variable was a game-based learning model constructed using the self-instruction strategy, and the dependent variables were sustained attention and impulsive inhibition. In this study, students' responses were observed and recorded in the experimental courses. Visual analysis, C statistics and qualitative interview were employed to understand the learning effect of the game-based learning model on the three subjects. The results of this study were as follows: (1) The game-based learning model had immediate and retention effects on the improvement of three ADHD students' distracted behavior. (2) The game-based learning model had immediate and retention effects on the impulse inhibition ability of the three ADHD students, but the former effect varied across students with different characteristics. (3) The game-based learning model was able to improve the learning performance of the three ADHD students.


3. 2021 The Implementation of Play-based Learning in Early Childhood Education: A Case Study of Teaching English as Foreign Language Program in Kindergartens in Vietnam
The world and modern technologies are constantly changing day by day; thus, children need updated skills to become a life-long learner so that they could survive through the change and create their own opportunities. It has long been acknowledged that there is a strong link between play and learning for young children, especially in the areas of problem solving, language acquisition, literacy and numeracy (OME 2010). Vietnam Innovative Early Childhood Education Program in 2009 (updated 2016) introduced the child-centered approach with emphases on learning through play as one of the main elements of the newly introduced Early Childhood Education curriculum (MOET, 2016). Despite getting trained, many teachers are still facing with many frustration and difficulties while integrating PBL into curriculum (Nguyen, 2017). It is, therefore, the purpose of this study to gain insights about understanding of Play-based Leaning (PBL) approach in Early Childhood Education (ECE), the implementation of PBL in Teaching English as Foreign Language (TEFL), the difficulties which teachers are facing to integrate PBL inside classroom as well as suggestions to overcome those difficulties. The study was conducted with a case study of a private educational system with three different schools in Vietnam. Data were mostly collected through semi-structured interviews with English teachers, teacher assistants and school managers as well as a review on monthly English curriculum and yearly English plan of the case kindergarten. From collected information, the study revealed that PBL in this case kindergarten is considered as “learning tables”, more directed and goal-oriented play. Difficulties and suggestions in implementation PBL in TEFL are more in curriculum and teacher, learning environment is generally satisfactory.
